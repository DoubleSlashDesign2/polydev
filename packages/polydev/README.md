> Faster, route-centric development for [Node.js][node] apps with built-in
> [Hot Module Replacement][hmr].

## Rationale

As your project grows, **working on a large or monolithic [Node.js][node] app gets slower**:

- Working on _part_ of the app means running the _entire_ app.
- The `require` tree grows so large it can take several seconds to start the server.
- Restarting the server on every change impedes development.
- Middleware for projects like [Next.js][next] & [Storybook][storybook] are expensive
  to restart with each change.
- Tools like [concurrently][concurrently], [nodemon][nodemon], & [piping][piping] still
  run the entire app.
- You shouldn't waste time in the terminal hitting <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd> and restarting.

## Features

- Fast startup.
- [Hot Module Replacement][hmr] built-in.
- Run only the parts of your app that's requested.
- Supports [yarn workspaces][workspaces].
- Pretty `404` screens with the option to create the missing route.
- Pretty `500` screens, so you spend less time in the terminal.
- Iterative adoption, so it's easy to get started.
